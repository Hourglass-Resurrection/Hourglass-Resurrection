// this is the mixing uber-function that does all the hard work.
// there is a heavy focus on performance here,
// so this tries to do everything and do it "well enough", with nothing really fancy.
// 
// FREQUENCY ADJUSTMENT:
//   this handles conversion from any frequency to any other frequency.
//   the adjustment amount is decided implicitly based on the ratio between size and outSize.
// BIT RATE CONVERSION:
//   this handles all possible combinations of bitrate conversions between the following types:
//   (8-bit signed, 8-bit unsigned, 16-bit signed, and 16-bit unsigned)
//   as determined by the types you specify for fromtype and totype.
//   in practice, only the following 4 combinations are useful:
//   (8-bit unsigned to 8-bit unsigned, 16-bit signed to 16-bit signed,
//    8-bit unsigned to 16-bit signed, and 16-bit signed to 8-bit unsigned)
//   however, it is recommended the mixing destination buffer always be 16-bit, for quality reasons.
// CHANNEL CONVERSION:
//   this handles all 4 possible combinations of channel conversions
//   (mono to mono, stereo to stereo, mono to stereo, and stereo to mono)
//   as determined by the values you specify for fromchannels and tochannels.
//   however, it is recommended the mixing destination buffer always be stereo, for quality reasons.
// PANNING AND VOLUME ADJUSTMENT:
//   the cached volume levels given are applied to the source audio when mixing.
//   this automatically includes panning, which applies for every case except (mono to mono) conversion.
// CLIPPING:
//   values exceeding the bounds of the destination bitrate will be clamped to within the valid range.
// INTERPOLATION:
//   this performs linear interpolation of samples.
//   some games would sound very noticeably wrong otherwise.
