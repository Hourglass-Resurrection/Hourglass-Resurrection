// declares trampolines for all global hooked functions
// and uses macros to locally replace direct calls to them with calls to their trampolines.
// also defines the trampoline functions if DEFINE_TRAMPS is defined.
// thus, exactly one file must define DEFINE_TRAMPS before including this.

/*
	In case you are totally lost about how this hooking stuff works,
	this explanation might clear things up:

	Hooking functions basically works like this:
	I want some function that's defined in a DLL (like timeGetTime)
	to call my own function instead of what it normally does.
	So I get the address of that function (using GetProcAddress),
	then I overwrite the first instruction inside that function
	with a jump instruction that goes to my own function (e.g. MytimeGetTime).
	
	This works great in some cases, but the problem is,
	what if I ever need to call the REAL timeGetTime from my own code?
	So what I do is also define another function (called a "trampoline function")
	whose purpose is to act like the original one when I call it.
	
	The way this trampoline function is implemented is that,
	before I overwrite the first instruction of timeGetTime,
	I copy that instruction into my trampoline function
	(otherwise it would be lost forever) and then immediately after that
	I write a jump to the second instruction of the original function.
	
	There's no normal code I could put in the trampoline function to do that,
	so instead I put some dummy code inside it that should never get called,
	which is later overwritten by those assembly instructions.
	I could dynamically allocate trampolines as they're needed, but
	I chose to (let the compiler) allocate them statically, to keep things simple.
	
	Finally, for my own code, I #define the original function
	to be the trampoline function.
	This way I can call the original as I normally would
	and behind the scenes it actually goes through the trampoline function
	to call it. (If I need to call the hooked version in my own code
	I can simply call my own function like MytimeGetTime directly,
	although that's usually a bad idea.)
