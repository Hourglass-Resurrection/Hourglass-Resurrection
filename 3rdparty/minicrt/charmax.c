*charmax.c - definition of _charmax variable
*
*       Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.
*
*Purpose:
*       defines _charmax
*
*       According to ANSI, certain elements of the lconv structure must be
*       initialized to CHAR_MAX and the value of CHAR_MAX changes when
*       the user compiles -J.  To reflect this change in the lconv structure,
*       we initialize the structure to SCHAR_MAX, and when any of the users
*       modules are compiled -J, the structure is updated.
*
*       Note that this is not done for DLLs linked to the CRT DLL, because
*       we do not want such DLLs to override the -J setting for an EXE
*       linked to the CRT DLL.  See comments in crtexe.c.
*
*       Files involved:
*
*       locale.h - if -J, generates an unresolved external to _charmax
*       charmax.c - defines _charmax and sets to UCHAR_MAX (255), places
*               _lconv_init in startup initializer table if pulled in by -J
*       lconv.c - initializes lconv structure to SCHAR_MAX (127),
*               since libraries built without -J
*       lcnvinit.c - sets lconv members to 25.
