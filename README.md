Hourglass Resurrection
======================

Automated builds: [Configuration:Debug](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/Warepire/hourglass-resurrection/artifacts/Hourglass-Resurrection-master.zip?branch=master&job=Configuration%3A+Debug) | [Configuration:Release](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/Warepire/hourglass-resurrection/artifacts/Hourglass-Resurrection-master.zip?branch=master&job=Configuration%3A+Release)

Goal
----
This project aims to improve Hourglass, the Windows TASing framework, which was created and maintained by Nitsuja and a few others like upthorn and Lex until 2011. Original project: http://code.google.com/p/hourglass-win32/

The goal is to clean up existing code and improve it where possible. Once the existing functionality has been ported, work will start on adding new functionality and increasing the compatability with games.

Updates
-------
Hourglass-Resurrection is developed mainly for the purpose of creating tool assisted superplays for submission to [TASVideos](http://tasvideos.org/). As such, much is done in collaboration and coordination with their community forum. Look in the [Hourglass section](http://tasvideos.org/forum/viewforum.php?f=61) for more up-to-date information.

Helping
-------
Hourglass-Resurrection is a big project, and as the original developer is no longer working on it, much of the code is not yet fully understood. There is still a lot of work to do, so any help you can offer is welcome. You don't have to be an expert coder to do this! Testing stability and functionality is just as welcome, just be detailed in the issue reports! Again, please refer to the [Hourglass section on TASVideos.org](http://tasvideos.org/forum/viewforum.php?f=61) for more information.

We're also on IRC: #hourglass at irc.freenode.net.
